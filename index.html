<h1>Fabian's blog about AI</h1>
<p>
In my opinion the topic of artificial intelligence is very difficult to
comprehend. Imagining a machine being smarter than human intelligence is 
a concept that a human brain has a hard time understanding.
</p>
<h2>Concept of AI</h2>
<p>
I never thought about the different concepts of artificial intelligence until
I read the blog post on wait but why. For me, artificial intelligence was just
one big concept, when in fact artificial intelligence can be divided in three
stages to further outline how artifical intelligence works.
<br>
The first stage can be defined as artificial narrow intelligence (ANI)
which only specializes in one area. This type of intelligence can't solve 
anything outside it's area of expertise. This stage already finds applications
in various fields of our daily life eventhough it might not always be understood, or 
referred to, as artificial intelligence.
<br>
The second stage is defined as artifical general intelligence (AGI) which
can perform any given task a human being could do and is therefore commonly
referred to as human-level AI. Humanity didn't archieve this stage yet.
The last stage is referred to as artificial superintelligence (ASI). This is 
basically an AGI which is much smarter than a human being and could therefore
perform tasks beyond our imagination maybe even conquer human death.
<br>
The last stage is also the reason why artificial intelligence is so interesting,
as the human mind has it's limits which the ASI doesn't have.
In my opinion the last two stages are both intimidating and exciting at the same time,
as a superintelligent AI could actually mean the destruction of human life as we know it.
<br>
The question that needs to be asked here is do we really need to fear this drastical kind of change?
</p>
<h2>Attitude towards AI</h2>
<p>
Against this background the development of the attitude towards 
artificial intelligence is very interesting to follow.
It starts with the opinion that artificial intelligence is not possible at all,
transitions to artificial intelligence is possible but very hard to archieve
and currently culminates in artifical intelligence is inevitably going to be
part of our lives. With the last station new opinions appeared stating that
artificial intelligence needs to be prevented in order to preserve human life.
<br>
I personally think that artificial intelligence can have a very big impact
on or daily life, but it needs to be approached with caution. I think the people
stating that we shouldn't further push the development of artificial intelligence
do have a point, but I also think that the are exaggerating their point of view
drastically.
</p>
<p>
For me it's still difficult to grasp how an artificial intelligence is implemented 
from a technical point of view.
<br>How is machine learning archieved? How does a neural network perform?
